## Vendor Web Sites

Students in the class ordered the supplies necessary for their labs from the following vendors:

[VWR](https://us.vwr.com/cms/science_education_lab_equipment)   
The first place to look for lab materials and supplies.

[Sigma-Aldrich](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/united-states.html)   
The first place to look for chemicals

[Invitrogen](http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home.html)   
Source for molecular biology material such as PCR reagents, DNA ladders, competent cells, etc.

[New England Biolabs](https://www.neb.com/)   
Source for molecular biology reagents, particularly restriction enzymes. Also has many useful tools like double digest finder and NEB cutter.
